- Do you like the [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide][org-tree-slide]] animations?  Yes?  Me too!
- You don't want to show all the slide's text at once while explaining, right?
- Do you want to hide some text first and showing it slowly and when the time comes?
- Do you remember the \pause at Beamer and you want it now?

Well, I thought "why not add a pause command at org-tree-slides?"!

This is what I mean:

[[./demos/pause1.gif]]

And this:

[[./demos/pause2.gif]]

* Usage
- List items and enumerations works automatically.
- Add one of the following to create a pause:

:   # pause
:   #+pause:
:   #+beamer: \pause

When you start to presenting with ~org-tree-slide-mode~ the text between  pauses will appear with the "shadow" face.  Use the C-> (M-x ~org-tree-slide-move-next-tree~) to show one by one. If there is no more text to reveal, the same command will show the next slide/title like usual.
