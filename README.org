- Do you like the [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide][org-tree-slide]] animations?  Yes?  Me too!
- You don't want to show all the slide's text at once while explaining, right?
- Do you want to hide some text first and showing it slowly and when the time comes?
- Do you remember the \pause at Beamer and you want it now?

Well, I thought "why not add a pause command at org-tree-slides?"!

This is what I mean:
