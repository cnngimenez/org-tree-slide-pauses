;;; Commentary:

;; Bring animation like in Beamer into your org-tree-slide presentations!
;;
;; Maunal installation:
;; Download the org-tree-slide-pauses.el.  Add the path to the `load-path'
;; variable and load it.  This can be added to the .emacs initialization file:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "path-to-where-the-el-file-is")
;;     (require 'org-tree-slide-pauses)
;;
;; Usage:
;; - List items and enumerations works automatically.
;; - Add one of the following to create a pause:
;;   # pause
;;   #+pause:
;;   #+beamer: \pause
;;
;; When you start to presenting with `org-tree-slide-mode' the text between
;; pauses will appear with the "shadow" face.  Use the C->
;; (M-x `org-tree-slide-move-next-tree') to show one by one.  If there is no
;; more text to reveal, the same command will show the next slide/title like
;; usual.
